# chef-project
Basic Chef Server Project

This document provides a comprehensive guide for installing and setting up Chef on Amazon Linux 2023. Follow these instructions to ensure proper installation and configuration.

### Launch EC2 and Connect via SSH

1. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023.
2. Connect to the instance using SSH.

### Step 1: Update the System

Ensure that all system packages are up-to-date with the latest updates and security patches:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

### Step 2: Download and Install Chef Workstation

Chef Workstation is a suite of tools for managing infrastructure and executing Chef recipes.

1. **Download the Chef Workstation package:**

    ```bash
    wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chef-workstation/24.4.1064/el/8/chef-workstation-24.4.1064-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
    ```

2. **Install the downloaded package:**

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -Uvh chef-workstation-24.4.1064-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
    ```

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

Confirm that Chef Workstation is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
chef --version
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error `/opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin/ruby: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypt.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`, resolve it by installing the necessary compatibility library:

```bash
sudo yum install libxcrypt-compat -y
```

### Step 4: Set Up a Chef Repository

1. **Create a Chef repository:**

    ```bash
    chef generate repo chef-repo
    cd chef-repo
    ```

2. **Create a Cookbook:**

    ```bash
    chef generate cookbook cookbooks/my_cookbook
    cd cookbooks/my_cookbook
    ```

3. **Write a Recipe:**

    Edit the `recipes/default.rb` file in your cookbook:

    ```bash
    nano recipes/default.rb
    ```

    Add the following content:

    ```ruby
    file '/tmp/greeting.txt' do
      content 'Hello, Chef!'
    end
    ```

### Step 5: Run Chef Client in Local Mode

Test your cookbook by executing Chef in local mode:

```bash
sudo chef-client --local-mode --runlist recipe[my_cookbook::default]
cat /tmp/greeting.txt
```

### Automation Script run:

1. Save the script as `setup_chef_project.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x setup_chef_project.sh
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./setup_chef_project.sh
    ```

This script handles the entire process from system update to Chef Workstation installation, repository setup, cookbook creation, recipe writing, and Chef client execution. Adjust the `CHEF_WORKSTATION_URL` and other variables as needed.
